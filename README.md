The ATHLO Fitness Web App is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to democratize access to fitness resources, trainer-led sessions.
It targets individual users seeking structured workout guidance, trainers who wish to manage schedules and client interactions, and administrators who require oversight tools.
The platform integrates a responsive frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a robust backend powered by Node.js and a MySQL relational database.
ATHLO provides categorized workout modules (Yoga, Cardio, Strength Training, and HIIT), multimedia tutorials, a slot booking system, and an e-commerce component that supports product listing and purchases.
The system emphasizes security, efficiency, and user experience, leveraging Restful APIs for client-server communication and optimized SQL schemas for transactional integrity.
This synopsis details the requirements, design decisions, system architecture, data flow, use cases, implementation roadmap, and expected outcomes for ATHLO. It also includes professional diagrams (DFD Level 0 & Level 1, Use Case, and System Flow) to illustrate system behavior and interactions.
